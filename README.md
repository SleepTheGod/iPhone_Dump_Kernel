This repository contains scripts to automate the setup for interacting with iOS devices and dumping kernel logs. It compiles the necessary tools, sets up udev rules, and provides instructions for entering DFU mode.

## Scripts

- **dump.sh**: This script dumps kernel logs and network status into a log file.

## Usage
